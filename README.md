# octoprint-tools-build
Build and install CuraEngine for the use with OctoPrint.
Intended to be run on a Debian Stretch installation. Works well on armbian (you need to update to stretch, though!).

Please note that I build the (not yet released!) 3.0 branch bby default, you might want to change the setting to 2.7.

All possible options are listed in the header of the script, modify as needed.

Building Cura and Slic3r-Prusa is also possible!
