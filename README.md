# 3d-printer-tools-build

Build and install 3d printer tools like Cura and Slic3r-Prusa. Also supports mjpg-streamer for octoprint.


Intended to be run on a Debian Stretch installation. Works well on armbian (you need to update to stretch, though!).

All possible options are listed in the header of the script, modify as needed.

How to build: Download build.sh (or git clone this repository) and run it as non-root user. Your user should have sudo permissions to do things as root user!
